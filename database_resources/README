Creating a New database.

Type in a terminal

cat lemon_mysql.sql | mysql -uroot -p

You must know the root password of mysql to do this. In Debian and 
Ubuntu, these password is created when installing msql-server. If you 
don't remember it, see the mysql doc in how to reset it.


DATABASE UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS LEMON VERSIONS
-----------

Note, you can update from previous lemon versions using the scripts in 
the migration folder,

From version 0.9.2 or newer:   

cat fix_0.9.3rc.sql | mysql -uroot -p

Aplly all the fixes in order until you get to the 0.9.5 fix.

-----

Note for UPGRADE from 0.9.1 / 0.9.2:

For 0.9.2 or 0.9.1, you need to run the fix_0.9.2.sql and fix_roles.sql scripts to upgrade to 0.9.3 version.

cat fix_0.9.2.sql | mysql -u root -p
cat fix_roles.sql | mysql -u root -p

-----


Previous versions of lemon:

If you have database for lemonpos 0.6 or 0.6.1 you can update it for the 0.7 version running:

cat upgrade-database_0.6_to_0.7.sql | mysql -u root -p

If you have 0.7 version, you can fix the database running:

cat fix_0.7.sql | mysql -u root -p

if You have 0.8 version, run the script:

cat fix_0.8.sql | mysql -u root -p


Alternatively and if you get confused in doing these migrations or you 
get in trouble with the database. You can export the important tables as 
.csv such as the products table, edit them in a program such as 
libreoffice calc. Create a new empty database for these lemon pos 
version. Adapt the tables to it, and reimport them. You can use a 
graphical program for this such as phpmyadmin.
